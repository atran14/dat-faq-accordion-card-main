## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM CSS
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have my hands-on on BEM, which admittedly was a bit overkill for a single FAQ-card, but I think it would be useful in some way to get used to this kind of style, especially going further on when tackling more complex projects.

As I have expected, I have the most trouble with stacking the SVGs properly without ruining the layout. While I have managed to somewhat recreate the original, I still feel that there are things in there that could be more optimized. Any feedback on this is appreciated!

### Continued development

Going forward, I will experiment with Gridbox and potentially use it in combination with Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/positioning#position) - This helped me centering horizontally one of the SVGs having absolute position.
